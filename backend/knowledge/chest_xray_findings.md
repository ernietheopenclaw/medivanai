# Common Chest X-ray Findings

## Cardiomegaly
Cardiothoracic ratio >0.5 on PA film. Causes: heart failure, valvular disease, cardiomyopathy, pericardial effusion. Recommend echocardiogram.

## Pneumonia
Consolidation (air bronchograms), lobar or patchy opacities. Correlate with clinical presentation. Start empiric antibiotics per local guidelines. Follow-up CXR in 6-8 weeks.

## Pleural Effusion
Blunting of costophrenic angle (>200mL). Lateral decubitus confirms free-flowing fluid. Consider thoracentesis if large or diagnostic uncertainty. Evaluate for CHF, infection, malignancy.

## Atelectasis
Volume loss with shift of fissures/mediastinum. Linear, plate-like, or lobar. Common post-operatively. Encourage deep breathing, incentive spirometry. Rule out endobronchial obstruction.

## Pneumothorax
Visceral pleural line with absent lung markings peripherally. Tension: mediastinal shift, hemodynamic compromise — requires emergent decompression. Small (<2cm): observe. Large: chest tube.

## Tuberculosis
Upper lobe predominant infiltrates, cavitation, tree-in-bud pattern. Obtain sputum AFB x3. Isolate patient. Report to public health. Start RIPE therapy if confirmed.

## Normal Chest X-ray
Clear lung fields, normal cardiac silhouette, no effusions, intact bony structures. Document as normal for baseline comparison.
