# Diabetic Retinopathy Grading Scale

## No DR (Grade 0)
No visible retinopathy. Annual screening recommended. Optimize glycemic control.

## Mild NPDR (Grade 1)
Microaneurysms only. Re-screen in 9-12 months. Target HbA1c < 7%.

## Moderate NPDR (Grade 2)
Microaneurysms, dot/blot hemorrhages, hard exudates, cotton wool spots. More than mild but less than severe. Refer to ophthalmology within 3-6 months.

## Severe NPDR (Grade 3)
Any of: >20 intraretinal hemorrhages in each quadrant, venous beading in 2+ quadrants, IRMA in 1+ quadrant. 4-2-1 rule. Urgent ophthalmology referral within 2-4 weeks. High risk (>50%) of progression to PDR within 1 year.

## Proliferative DR (Grade 4)
Neovascularization of disc or elsewhere, vitreous/preretinal hemorrhage. Immediate referral. Treatment: anti-VEGF injections, panretinal photocoagulation, vitrectomy if needed.

## Management Principles
- Glycemic control (HbA1c < 7%) reduces progression by 76%
- Blood pressure control (<130/80) is critical
- Lipid management reduces hard exudate formation
- Pregnancy may accelerate DR — screen each trimester
