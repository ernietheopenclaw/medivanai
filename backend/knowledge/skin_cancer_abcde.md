# ABCDE Criteria for Melanoma Detection

## Asymmetry
One half of the mole does not match the other half. Benign moles are typically symmetric.

## Border
Edges are irregular, ragged, notched, or blurred. Melanoma borders tend to be uneven.

## Color
Color is not uniform. May include shades of brown, black, pink, red, white, or blue. Multiple colors in one lesion raise suspicion.

## Diameter
Melanomas are usually greater than 6mm (pencil eraser size) when diagnosed, but can be smaller.

## Evolving
Any change in size, shape, color, elevation, or new symptom (bleeding, itching, crusting) is concerning.

## When to Refer
- Any lesion meeting 2+ ABCDE criteria → dermatology referral
- Rapidly changing lesion → urgent referral within 2 weeks
- "Ugly duckling" sign: lesion that looks different from patient's other moles

## Risk Factors for Melanoma
- Fair skin, light eyes, red/blonde hair
- History of blistering sunburns
- >50 common moles or >5 atypical moles
- Family history of melanoma
- Personal history of melanoma or other skin cancers
- Immunosuppression
